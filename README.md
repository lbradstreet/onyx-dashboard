## Design and User Guide

A description and user guide disguised as a blog post can be found [here](http://lbradstreet.github.io/clojure/onyx/distributed-systems/2015/02/18/onyx-dashboard.html).

## Versioning

Version numbers will kept in sync with [Onyx]
(https://github.com/onyx-platform/onyx). For example, to use a version
compatible with Onyx `0.8.1.0-alpha8`, use a version of the dashboard beginning with
`0.8.1.0-alpha8`. The fourth version number will be reserved for dashboard versioning, in
order to provide releases out of band with Onyx.

Releases are listed at [RELEASES.md](RELEASES.md).

## Deployment

Run the jar via:
```
java -server -jar onyx-dashboard-VERSION.jar ZOOKEEPER_ADDR
```

By default the server will listen on port 3000, but this can be configured via the PORT environment variable.

Alternately, run the docker image like so:
```
git@github.com:drewverlee/onyx-dashboard.git
```

The IP passed in is used by ZooKeeper.

## Development

In a terminal start a sample job and cluster to dashboard against:
```
lein run -m onyx.peer.dag-test
```

Then start developyment:

Run `lein repl` to start your repl.

In the REPL, run
```clojure
(onyx-dashboard.dev/start-figwheel)
```

Then run:

```clojure
(user/stop) (clojure.tools.namespace.repl/refresh) (user/go "127.0.0.1:2188")
```
to start the server, and each time you make a change on the server.

Then point your browser at http://localhost:3000/
